            <h3>Problem Statement</h3>
        </div>
        <div class="text-div">
            <p>I can’t imagine being a kid today – managing so much pressure to be forged for success in adulthood at such relatively young ages, having to commit to specialties so fully that there’s room for little else, navigating social pressures that are often exacerbated by superficial social-media-driven connectivity, and trying to grow up in a societal atmosphere where there seems to be more sharp division and intolerance than usual.</p>
            <p>All together, these things must leave kids feeling a ton of pressure to rigidly declare who they are when instead, they should be granted a lot of space and patience to develop more gradually.</p>
        </div>





        <div>
            <h3>Idea</h3>
        </div>

        <!-- <div>
            <h2>I can see myself in all things and all people around me.</h2>
            <h4>–Sanskrit Phrase</h4>
        </div> -->

        <div class="text-div">
            <p>I’m inspired to help kids, preteens in particular, to feel moored in their (developing) inner sense of themselves and how they want to be in the world in the face of the demands and stressors that are upon them.</p>

            <p>I intend to go at this with a focus on the basics: Helping kids learn how to recognize their feelings, and to help them grow their understanding of the nuances of those feelings and what they mean. The hopeful outcome of providing this is that it will ultimately engrain the skills needed to be compassionate toward themselves and empathetic toward others.</p>

            <p>I found support for this desire beautifully articulated by the author of <a href="https://childhood101.com/managing-big-emotions-best-resources-to-use-with-kids/">Childhood 101.</a></p>

            <p>"There is no one-size-fits-all lesson for helping children to understand feelings, it takes many, regular touches as a child moves through the following stages of emotional development;
                <ul>
                    <li>Recognising a range of emotions in themselves and others.</li>
                    <li>Recognising the physical and emotional responses we have to each of these emotions.</li>
                    <li>Learning to express their own feelings verbally.</li>
                    <li>Learning to calm oneself down in the face of overwhelming emotions.</li>
                    <li>Learning to treat others with kindness and empathy."</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
        </div>

            <h3>Objective</h3>
        </div>
        <div class="text-div">
            <p>Through the creation of app based learning modules that support the development of emotional intelligence, which may be supplemental to lesson plans or a separate activity to be used at the discretion of educators,  I hope to enable reflection and validation that contributes positively to nurturing self&dash; and social&dash; awareness within middle school aged kids. Stated in a single sentence, the crux of this project is about:</p>
