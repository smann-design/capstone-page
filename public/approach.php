            <h4>Kids &amp; Mindfulness</h4>
            <p>In the course of my research, I was pleasantly surprised to find that the teaching of things like mindfulness and conflict resolution is already present in, or beginning to permeate, childhood education.</p>
            <p>For example, Mellennium School, a private middle school in San Fransico, starts by asking kids to state their vision for how they want to be in the world and what they want to offer to it.</p>
            <p>The position of these educators is that in our fast paced, largely superficial, and overly scheduled world kids need guidance and encouragement to recognize themselves in it. With the ability to do so, they are better able to summon bit of quiet in the chaos. They can learn to live by their own intent, rather than in reactive mode. This is the first step, understanding their internal world.</p>
            <p>When kids have been granted the space and encouragement to understand their inner worlds, to be truthful about their own apprehensions, challenges, or successes, they can then relate to others (in addition to  themselves) with generosity, patience, compassion, and empathy. They are more capable of skillfully navigating their outer world.</p>
            <p>My project seeks to develop a means to this end at a primary level: by broadening a child's understanding of their own feelings, leveraging the <a href="https://www.ahaparenting.com/FeelingsWheel">Feelings Wheel</a> as a model which is credited to Dr. Gloria Willcox for its invention as a tool to help people clarify their emotions.</p>

            <h4>Kids &amp; Visual Landscape</h4>
            <p>My research into the gammut of media that middle school children are interested in reflects my hypothesis about children of this age managing an undercurrent of change.</p>
            <p>The landscape of visual imagery that appeals to them spans the upper measure of the simple and childish to the lower measure of daring and sophisticated, harkening to them holding on to their innocene in one hand while reaching for maturity with the other.</p>
            <p>The execution of artwork for my app will lean in the direction of the simpler and more childish inspired by some of my first hand observations of my step children in which it was clear that they would, at times, momentarily regress in their behavioral maturity. Not in terms of being "naugty", but in terms of how they'd entertain themselves. It was clear that they were retreating to things that offered them emotional or social comfort, or possibly a break from continuous expectations.</p>
            <p>It's my hope that these learning modules might offer a small respite or comfort from the increasing and growing expectations of preteens.</p>

            <p>Throughout the Whole U app, users will become acquainted with characters who represent the core feelings on the Feelings Wheel, and one owl character who takes the role of MC or tour guide on the path to wisdom.
            <p>Animals have been intentionally chosen to demonstrate emotions (vs. human characters) in order to endear the user, as much as to avoid associations with someone whom a human based character might possibly resemble in the user's real world.</p>

            <p>We don’t have to tell you,</p>
            <p>You witness it daily,</p>
            <p>Preteen years are a pivotal time when your students are most likely feeling the powerful undercurrent of change as they begin to independently make their own way in the world.</p>
            <p>
                <ul>
                    <li>They’re finding themselves with less and less downtime as their schedules become more and more demanding.</li>
                    <li>They’re feeling awkward about the way their bodies are changing.</li>
                    <li>They’re confronted with anxiety that can come with making and maintaining their friend networks.</li>
                    <li>They may even be missing the sense of safety and security they felt in the way they were cared for as younger children.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>You get it.</p>
            <p>And like us, you may appreciate the borrowed phrase: “We’re not raising children, we’re raising adults.”</p>
            <p>You may also agree that with reasonable amounts of guided direction, preteens can develop their ability to have the patience, self-compassion and empathy for others that will help them navigate their current challenges and change…</p>
            <p>as well as become whole and grounded people.</p>
            <p>It’s our belief that EXPLORING FEELINGS is a great place to start.</p>
            <p>With our Whole U app, just 10 minutes of light-hearted, gentle-engagement interaction, allows kids to broaden their awareness of their feelings, and the many different ways they manifest.</p>
            <p>It sounds simple but it’s powerful.</p>
            <p>When kids learn intellectually about feelings, they’re better equipped to:</p>
            <p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Recognize that it’s normal and OK to feel what they feel.</li>
                    <li>They can more effectively discuss and clarify what they feel and therefore resolve problems.</li>
                    <li>And ultimately, they can learn that while a feeling may be present, it needn’t obscure them entirely… It doesn’t have to overrun them to be valid or valued.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>And we leave it at that.</p>
            <p>Just a little bit of individual time with the Whole U app to explore the universe of feelings via some simple but fun demonstrations.</p>
            <p>No specific outcomes, no quiz, no concerted thinking, no right or wrong.</p>
            <p>Just getting acquainted with the broad spectrum of feelings that we are all capable of having.</p>
            <p>It’s a great foundation builder toward becoming people who’re effective at:</p>
            <p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Getting their emotional needs met in healthy ways.</li>
                    <li>Resolving conflict with positive outcomes.</li>
                    <li>Respecting the value and worth of themselves and others.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>And your students are sure to love the break in the demands of learning, and recognition that they are sensitive beings.</p>
